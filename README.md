## Installation

Texture is available via CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager. See our [Installation](http://texturegroup.org/docs/installation.html) guide for instructions.

### Swift Package Manager

Texture supports Swift Package Manager with Package Traits for modular feature integration.

#### Basic Usage (AsyncDisplayKit only)

Most users just need the core AsyncDisplayKit functionality:

```swift
// In your Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture.git", from: "3.3.0")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourApp",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "AsyncDisplayKit", package: "Texture")
        ]
    )
]
```

**Default Features (included automatically):**
- Core AsyncDisplayKit (ASDisplayNode, ASImageNode, ASTextNode, etc.)
- PINRemoteImage integration (ASPINRemoteImageDownloader)
- Video support (AVFoundation, CoreMedia)
- MapKit integration
- Photos framework
- AssetsLibrary (iOS only)

**No trait configuration needed** - all these features work out of the box!

#### Advanced Usage: IGListKit Integration

For advanced collection view support with IGListKit, you need **both steps**:

1. **Enable the IGListKit trait** on the package dependency
2. **Add the TextureIGListKitExtensions product** to your target

```swift
// In your Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture.git",
        from: "3.3.0",
        traits: [.init(name: "IGListKit")]  // Step 1: Enable trait
    )
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourApp",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "AsyncDisplayKit", package: "Texture"),
            .product(name: "TextureIGListKitExtensions", package: "Texture")  // Step 2: Add product
        ]
    )
]
```

**Why both steps?** Due to Swift Package Manager limitations, traits apply to the entire package, not individual products. This means you must explicitly enable the IGListKit trait AND add the product dependency. See [Issue #8350](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues/8350) for details.

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- **SPM uses IGListKit 5.0+** (breaking changes from 4.x used in CocoaPods/Carthage)
- **Not a drop-in replacement** - migration and testing required
- **No Carthage/CocoaPods support planned** - we recommend migrating to SPM
- Provides Swift API: `ListAdapter.setCollectionNode(_:)` (replaces Objective-C `setASDKCollectionNode:`)

#### Migrating from CocoaPods to SPM

If you're migrating from CocoaPods, here's how the subspecs map to SPM features:

| Feature | CocoaPods | SPM | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Core** | `pod 'Texture'` (default) | `.product(name: "AsyncDisplayKit", ...)` | ✅ Always included |
| **PINRemoteImage** | Included by default | Always included | ✅ Same behavior |
| **Video** | Included by default | Default trait (enabled) | ✅ Same behavior |
| **MapKit** | Included by default | Default trait (enabled) | ✅ Same behavior |
| **Photos** | Included by default | Default trait (enabled) | ✅ Same behavior |
| **AssetsLibrary** | Included by default | Default trait (enabled) | ✅ Same behavior |
| **IGListKit** | `pod 'Texture/IGListKit'` | Trait + product (see above) | ⚠️ Uses IGListKit 5.0+ |
| **TextNode2** | `pod 'Texture/TextNode2'` | Enabled by default | ✅ Modern TextNode used |
| **Yoga** | `pod 'Texture/Yoga'` | Not supported | Add as separate dependency |

**Key differences:**
- **TextNode2 is default**: SPM uses the modern TextNode implementation automatically (no legacy TextNode)
- ⚠️ **IGListKit version**: SPM uses IGListKit 5.0+ instead of 4.x (breaking changes)
- ℹ️ **Yoga**: Not integrated in SPM - add Yoga as a separate dependency if needed

#### Note for Contributors

When adding or removing source files in the `Source/` directory, you must regenerate the SPM symlink structure:

```bash
# Regenerate SPM layout
swift scripts/generate_spm_sources_layout.swift

# Commit the generated changes
git add spm/Sources
git commit -m "Update SPM layout for new/removed files"
```

**Important:** Always commit the generated `spm/Sources` directory changes along with your source file changes. This ensures SPM users can build the project correctly.

## Performance Gains

Texture's basic unit is the `node`. An ASDisplayNode is an abstraction over `UIView`, which in turn is an abstraction over `CALayer`. Unlike views, which can only be used on the main thread, nodes are thread-safe: you can instantiate and configure entire hierarchies of them in parallel on background threads.

To keep its user interface smooth and responsive, your app should render at 60 frames per second — the gold standard on iOS. This means the main thread has one-sixtieth of a second to push each frame. That's 16 milliseconds to execute all layout and drawing code! And because of system overhead, your code usually has less than ten milliseconds to run before it causes a frame drop.

Texture lets you move image decoding, text sizing and rendering, layout, and other expensive UI operations off the main thread, to keep the main thread available to respond to user interaction.

## Advanced Developer Features

As the framework has grown, many features have been added that can save developers tons of time by eliminating common boilerplate style structures common in modern iOS apps. If you've ever dealt with cell reuse bugs, tried to performantly preload data for a page or scroll style interface or even just tried to keep your app from dropping too many frames you can benefit from integrating Texture.
